Problem Statement
A die marked A to E is rolled 50 times. Find the probability of getting a "D" exactly 5 times.

Solution:
n = 50, 
n - k = 45
k = 5

The probability of success = probability of getting a "D" = s = 1/5
The probability of failure = probability of not getting a "D" = 1 - s = 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.
